# Project Brief
This is a website where parents or guardians can register there child to the youth club or make enquires using the webistes messaging service.

# User Stories
1. As a user I would like to find out more about the youth club and register my child. 
2. As a user I want to be able to upload and delete form information to register my child to the youth group. 
3. As an administrator I want to be able to manage users.

# Features
Each custom model should have the CRUD functionality. I have detailed each models functionality below.
1. CRUD Functionality of the registration model:
Create- To be able to register your child to the youth club. 
Read- To be able to see your information uploaded once you have logged in. This needs to be secure to each user as it is personal date.
Update- To be able to update your information were applicable.
Delete- To be able to delete any information that no longer applies to your child or their application.

2. Other features:
- A log in page for users so that their information is secure.
- Navagation links to each page for best user experience.

# Summary


# Testing Results
One error that I ran into was during migrations. I wanted to update my model after an inital migration. To fix this I had to delete the migration files and run migrations again.

Another error that I found was getting the form model to display on the html page. 
Another error that I ran into whilst trying to solve this one was an attritute error. Both remain unfixed.
